summary: 'How to redirect after a successful form submission in Contact Form 7'
---

Add the following code to your `functions.php` file:

```php
add_action( 'wp_footer', 'dtp_contact_form_7_redirection' );
function dtp_contact_form_7_redirection() {
	?>
	<script>
		document.addEventListener( 'wpcf7mailsent', function( event ) {
			location = 'http://example.com/thank-you/';
		}, false );
	</script>
	<?php
}
``` 
 This code will redirect the user to `http://example.com/thank-you/` after a successful form submission. 
 Replace `http://example.com/thank-you/` with the URL you want to redirect to. 
 You can also add this code to a custom JavaScript file and enqueue it in your theme's `functions.php` file. 
 If you want to redirect to a different URL based on the form submitted, you can use the `event.detail.contactFormId` property to get the form ID and then use a switch statement to redirect to different URLs based on the form ID. 
 Here's an example: 
 ```javascript
document.addEventListener( 'wpcf7mailsent', function( event ) {
	switch ( event.detail.contactFormId ) {
		case 123:
			location = 'http://example.com/thank-you-form-123/';
			break;
		case 456:
			location = 'http://example.com/thank-you-form-456/';
			break;
		default:
			location = 'http://example.com/thank-you/';
	}
}, false );
``` 
 This code will redirect to different URLs based on the form submitted. Replace `123` and `456` with the form IDs you want to redirect for. 
 You can also use the `event.detail.inputs` property to get the form input values and use them to customize the redirection URL. 
 Here's an example: 
 ```javascript
